2 Weeks -> SITE WILL BE SENT TO USERS -> Volunteers and orgs should have full functionality.

# Unassigned
 - [ ] add photo consent to form, disabled by default
 - [ ] Volunteer Form -> checkbox for "is 18 or older" -> if under request that they have their parent/guardian signup for them and kick back to homepage
 - [ ] The JavaScript in lib.js is not handling refreshing the page after deleting a volunteer form correctly

 - [ ] Monetary Donations -> Unsure if should show amount, or at all. Ask Brandy next week
 - [ ] Merge function -> Given individualID old and new, replace all individualID-old links with individualID-new (next year)

# Walter's

 - [x] Needs to show all different contact methods
 - [ ] Add uids to display frontend for individual search
 - [ ] On signup page, pickeruppers -> Continue and Add Adult buttons need to be flipped

# Rayna's
