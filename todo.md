 - [x] Add uids to display frontend for individual search
 - [x] On signup page, pickeruppers -> Continue and Add Adult buttons need to be flipped

# Rayna's
 - [x] DeleteFormVolunteer is not working (Wasn't actually broken, as an issue in the JS)
 - [x] createFormLink -> Should verify that that individual is not already linked to that form
 - [x] Delete Form/VolunteerForm should auto delete the FormLink/FormVolunteerLink entries for the form
 - [x] No email for Individual created via Form -> remove that option from the Signup Form frontend
 - [x] Change DB so that allowPhotos in on the form, not the individual
 - [x] The JavaScript in lib.js is not handling refreshing the page after deleting a volunteer form correctly
