<Question>
My child has food allergies? Can we still participate?
<Answer>
Absolutely! Your lunches will be packed in a white bag with a label on the front with your child's name and their allergens listed. Your name will also be highlighted on the check off sheet and your drop off volunteer will be made aware of your situation. Brandy takes care of all of the allergy bags to make sure that everything is allergen free. The more specific you are when listing allergens, the better.
